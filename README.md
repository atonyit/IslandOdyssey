# Island Odyssey

Second Project for COSC1437

The finished product made in XCode

My first "major" project made entirely in C++, utilizing the many different features of C++ and totaling over 700 lines of code!

Problems I encountered but didn't have the time to fix:
- First, the ship's fuel stays the same no matter the number of islands visited or how long the ship is "sailing".
- I tried implementing many changes to improve the randomness of events, but could never get it to work perfectly. The events don't
occur as frequently as I would like.

  
# Island Game

This repository contains the source code for a complex simulation game titled "Island Game". Players navigate various islands, manage resources, and face random events that can impact their journey.

## Features

- Explore different islands with unique challenges and treasures.
- Manage ship resources including fuel and crew.
- Encounter random events like storms, pirate attacks, and mythical creatures.
- Upgrade ships and utilize special abilities for strategic advantages.

## How to Compile and Run

The game is written in C++ and can be compiled using any standard C++ compiler like g++, clang++, or Visual C++.

Make sure all the .cpp files are in the same directory and replace 'main.cpp', 'gameManager.cpp', etc., with the actual paths to your source files if they are located in different directories.

## Game Play

1. Start the game and manage your initial resources.
2. Choose to explore islands, each with different potential rewards and risks.
3. Manage your ship's health and fuel to ensure you can continue your adventure.
4. Upgrade your ship and handle random events that can either aid or hinder your progress.
