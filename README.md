# Island Odyssey

Second Project for COSC1437

The finished product made in XCode
Uses C++ to create an Island exploration game

Conceptualized and implemented the core game mechanics to portray island exploration, resource management, and
event handling.
Utilized different classes (polymorphism) to create diverse behaviors for ships, islands, and events, enhancing the 
gameplay experience with unique challenges and strategies.
Developed a system to generate random events both on the ocean and on the islands, affecting gameplay based on the 
island the player decides to explore and ship attributes.
Implemented file I/O operations to allow players to save and load game progress, ensuring data persistence.

My first "major" project made in C++, utilizing the many different features of C++ and totaling over 700 lines of code!

Problems I encountered but didn't have the time to fix:
- First, the ship's fuel stays the same no matter the number of islands visited or how long the ship is "sailing".
- I tried implementing many changes to improve the randomness of events, but could never get it to work perfectly. The events don't
- occur has frequently as I would like.
